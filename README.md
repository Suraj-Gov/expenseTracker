# expenseTracker

A new Flutter project to learn design in flutter, business logic and how to implement custom widgets. Dark theme FTW.

## Plans

- Have widgets that show your expenses along with the amount and the date. (future plan is to add animations so that when I tap on a expense widget, the date slides in view from behind the widget)  partially done.

- Have a main input widget that shows two textfields and accepts the expense name and amount. DONE!

- Have a date picker. DONE!

- Make a custom widget showing the expense summary for a week.  DONE!
